# BigQuery-Ad-Insights
NOTE: My project includes geodata, gender data, device data and age data but I have not included them on here as those metrics are reserved for the use of my client. References to the usage of these metrics are available upon request hd1202@nyu.edu.

Utilizing BigQuery's BI engine I scheduled queries and assigned them to destinations for live dashboard data via Looker Studio. Ad insights include Facebook, Google, Instagram and Bing.

I cleaned data via window functions and subqueries practices; duplicate data is as follows: cost of campaign with no purchases is counted again as a separate data point after someone makes a purchase.
